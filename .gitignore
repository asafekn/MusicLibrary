# .gitignore is a file that lists names of directories and files
# that 'git' should ignore. We want to ignore things that are not
# source code. This includes:
#
#   * User data (like our database)
#   * Compilation outputs
#   * Downloaded modules
#   * Anything else that can be generated from the data that we already track with git

# Ignore JavaScript's local modules directory
node_modules

# Ignore the database
*.db

# Ignore Elm's packages directory
elm-stuff
